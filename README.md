# Systemic Crisis Prediction in Africa (1860–2014)

## 📊 Overview

This project explores the **"Systemic Crisis, Banking Crisis, Inflation Crisis in Africa"** dataset sourced from Kaggle. The primary objective is to build a **Machine Learning classification model** to **predict the likelihood of a systemic financial crisis** using macroeconomic indicators such as inflation rates, among others.

The dataset spans **13 African countries** from **1860 to 2014**, covering events related to:

* Banking Crisis
* Debt Crisis
* Financial Crisis
* Inflation Crisis
* Systemic Crisis

## 🌍 Countries Included

* Algeria
* Angola
* Central African Republic
* Ivory Coast
* Egypt
* Kenya
* Mauritius
* Morocco
* Nigeria
* South Africa
* Tunisia
* Zambia
* Zimbabwe
